Trivia Genius is a full-stack web application created by the Winter 2023 Cohort of JRS Coding School.

### 🛠️ Installation
1. Open integrated terminals for the "api" and "ui" folders.
2. In each terminal, run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Make sure you have an instance of Docker running.
4. Create a database named `workoutbud_db`. 
6. In the "api" intergrated terminal, run `npx knex migrate:latest` and `npx knex seed:run` to create and seed tables

### 🚀 Starting the app
1. Using both intergrated terminals, run `npm start` to start the app!
